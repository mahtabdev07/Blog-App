npx shadcn-ui@latest add button
npx shadcn-ui@latest add card
\`\`\`

## Example Usage

\`\`\`tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"

export function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Card>
      <CardHeader>
        <CardTitle>Welcome</CardTitle>
      </CardHeader>
      <CardContent>
        <Button>Get Started</Button>

        "Master advanced TypeScript patterns to write more robust and maintainable React applications.",
      content: `TypeScript and React make a powerful combination. Here are some advanced patterns that will level up your development.

## Generic Components

Create reusable components with generics:

\`\`\`tsx
interface ListProps<T> {
  items: T[]
  renderItem: (item: T) => React.ReactNode
}

function List<T>({ items, renderItem }: ListProps<T>) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {items.map((item, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{renderItem(item)}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
\`\`\`

## Discriminated Unions

Handle different states elegantly:

\`\`\`tsx
type LoadingState = { status: 'loading' }
type SuccessState = { status: 'success'; data: any[] }
type ErrorState = { status: 'error'; error: string }

type State = LoadingState | SuccessState | ErrorState

function handleState(state: State) {
  switch (state.status) {
    case 'loading':
      return <div>Loading...</div>
    case 'success':
      return <div>Data: {state.data.length} items</div>
    case 'error':
      return <div>Error: {state.error}</div>
  }
}
\`\`\`

These patterns help create more robust and maintainable applications.`,

      excerpt:
        "Learn essential database design principles to build scalable and maintainable data models.",
      content: `Good database design is crucial for building scalable applications. Here are key principles to follow.

## Normalization

Normalize your data to reduce redundancy:

### First Normal Form (1NF)
- Each column contains atomic values
- No repeating groups

### Second Normal Form (2NF)
- Must be in 1NF
- All non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key

### Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Must be in 2NF
- No transitive dependencies

## Indexing Strategy

### Primary Keys
Always use meaningful primary keys when possible.

### Foreign Keys
Ensure referential integrity with proper foreign key constraints.

### Performance Indexes
Add indexes on columns used in WHERE clauses and JOINs.

## Data Types

Choose appropriate data types:
- Use specific numeric types (INT, BIGINT)
- VARCHAR for variable-length strings
- TEXT for large text content
- TIMESTAMP for date/time data

These principles will help you build robust, scalable databases.`,

        "Learn when and how to use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create responsive layouts efficiently.",
      content: `CSS Grid and Flexbox are powerful layout systems that complement each other. Understanding when to use each is key to efficient web development.

## CSS Grid: For 2D Layouts

Grid excels at creating complex, two-dimensional layouts:

\`\`\`css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}
\`\`\`

### When to Use Grid:
- Complex page layouts
- Card-based designs
- Magazine-style layouts
- When you need precise control over rows and columns

## Flexbox: For 1D Layouts

Flexbox is perfect for one-dimensional layouts:

\`\`\`css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  gap: 1rem;
}
\`\`\`

### When to Use Flexbox:
- Navigation bars
- Centering content
- Distributing space between items
- Simple responsive designs

## Combining Both

The real power comes from combining Grid and Flexbox:

\`\`\`css
.page-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "header header"
    "sidebar main"
    "footer footer";
}

.header {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
\`\`\`

Organize your code for scalability:

\`\`\`
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui/           # Reusable UI components
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/     # Feature-specific components
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ layouts/      # Layout components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ hooks/            # Custom hooks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/         # API and external services
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/           # Utility functions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/           # TypeScript definitions
\`\`\`

## Component Design Principles

### Single Responsibility
Each component should have one clear purpose:

\`\`\`tsx
// ‚ùå Too many responsibilities
function UserDashboard() {
  // Handles user data, notifications, settings, analytics...
}

// ‚úÖ Single responsibility
function UserProfile() {
  // Only handles user profile display
}
\`\`\`

### Composition over Inheritance
Use composition to build complex UIs:

\`\`\`tsx
function Card({ children, header, footer }) {
  return (
    <div className="card">
      {header && <div className="card-header">{header}</div>}
      <div className="card-body">{children}</div>
      {footer && <div className="card-footer">{footer}</div>}
    </div>
  )
}
\`\`\`

## State Management

Choose the right tool for your needs:
- **Local state**: useState, useReducer
- **Server state**: React Query, SWR
- **Global state**: Zustand, Redux Toolkit

## Performance Optimization

- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement proper key props
- Lazy load components and routes
- Optimize bundle size

Following these patterns will help you build maintainable, scalable React applications.`,

      excerpt:
        "Explore modern authentication methods including JWT, OAuth, and passwordless authentication.",
      content: `Authentication has evolved significantly. Modern applications require robust, secure, and user-friendly authentication systems.

## JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

JWTs provide a stateless authentication mechanism:

\`\`\`typescript
interface JWTPayload {
  sub: string    // User ID
  exp: number    // Expiration time
  iat: number    // Issued at
  email: string  // User email
}
\`\`\`

### JWT Best Practices:
- Use short expiration times
- Implement token refresh mechanisms
- Store tokens securely (httpOnly cookies)
- Include minimal necessary data

## OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect

OAuth provides secure third-party authentication:

### Benefits:
- Users don't need to create new accounts
- Reduced password management
- Leverages existing trusted providers

### Implementation:
\`\`\`typescript
// Using NextAuth.js
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  providers: [
    GoogleProvider({
      clientId: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID!,
      clientSecret: process.env.GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET!,
    }),
  ],
}
\`\`\`

## Passwordless Authentication

Modern alternative using magic links or codes:

### Advantages:
- Better user experience
- Eliminates password-related vulnerabilities
- Reduces support burden

### Implementation Flow:
1. User enters email
2. Send magic link/code
3. User clicks link or enters code
4. Create authenticated session

## Security Considerations

- Always use HTTPS
- Implement rate limiting
- Use CSRF protection
- Validate all inputs
- Keep dependencies updated

Choose authentication methods that balance security with user experience.`,
